Enterprise IT Audit & Compliance Management System (SOC Ready)
Overview

The Enterprise IT Audit and Compliance Management System is a centralized platform designed to support organizations in managing IT audits, risks, controls, and compliance activities. The project simulates real-world SOC 1, SOC 2, and ISO audit workflows with a strong focus on audit readiness, structured evidence management, remediation tracking, and consistent handling of client security questionnaires. The system reflects how IT Audit and Risk teams operate within large enterprise environments.

Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to centralize audit programs, risks, and controls into a single system while simplifying audit evidence collection and validation. It aims to provide clear visibility into audit findings and remediation activities, improve overall audit readiness, and enable faster, standardized responses to client security questionnaires.

Key Functionality
Audit Program and Risk Management

The system allows the creation of audit programs aligned with SOC and ISO standards. Risks can be identified, categorized based on severity, and mapped directly to relevant controls, ensuring traceability and structured risk management.

Control and Evidence Repository

A centralized control repository is maintained to store and manage audit evidence such as policies, system logs, and screenshots. Each piece of evidence is linked to specific controls and tracked throughout the audit lifecycle to ensure completeness and accuracy.

Audit Findings and Remediation Tracking

Audit observations and findings can be recorded within the system along with assigned remediation owners and target closure dates. The platform enables continuous monitoring of remediation progress to support timely closure of audit issues.

Client Security Questionnaire Management

The system supports structured handling of client security questionnaires by storing commonly requested security questions and approved responses. This allows consistent and efficient responses to recurring client audit and security requests, with the ability to export responses in standard document formats.

Security Metrics and Reporting

The platform provides visibility into key information security metrics such as audit readiness, open and closed findings, risk distribution, and overall compliance status, enabling informed decision-making by stakeholders.

Technology Stack

The application is designed using a simple and practical technology stack, with a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend developed using Java with Spring Boot or Python with Flask. MySQL is used for data storage, while reporting and documentation outputs are generated in Excel and Word formats. Role-based access control is implemented to support different user roles such as administrators, auditors, and control owners.

Real-World Relevance

This project closely mirrors real IT Audit and Information Security Governance activities commonly performed in enterprise organizations. It reflects hands-on exposure to SOC audit preparation, risk and control assessments, audit evidence validation, remediation management, and client security questionnaire handling, making it highly relevant for IT Audit and Risk roles.

Future Scope

Future enhancements to the system may include automated audit reminders, expanded cloud security control mapping, integration with enterprise ticketing tools, and advanced analytics to identify risk trends and improve audit efficiency.
